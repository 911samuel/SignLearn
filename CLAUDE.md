# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

SignLearn is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system. It uses MediaPipe Hands for landmark extraction and a stacked LSTM model for sequence classification across 75 vocabulary classes (26 letters, 10 digits, 39 common words).

**Member A** (this context): ML/AI Lead — data pipeline, model design, training, MediaPipe extraction.  
**Member B**: Full-Stack + Frontend Lead — Flask backend, WebSocket, React UI, speech-to-text.

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify webcam + MediaPipe are working (smoke test)
python scripts/test_mediapipe.py

# Collect a landmark sequence sample (30 frames → .npy)
python scripts/extract_landmarks.py --out data/processed/<label>/sample_001.npy --frames 30

# Verify raw dataset image integrity
python backend/data_verification.py data/raw/digits

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a specific test file verbosely
pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -v
```

Note: `tests/test_pipeline.py` requires `data/processed/sample.npy` to exist (run `extract_landmarks.py` first).

## Architecture

### ML Pipeline

**Input → Landmark extraction → Sequence → LSTM → Prediction**

1. Webcam frame → MediaPipe Hands → 21 landmarks × 3 coords = 63 floats per frame
2. 30 consecutive frames → shape `(30, 63)` float32 array (zero-padded if no hand detected)
3. Two-layer stacked LSTM → softmax over 75 classes
4. Target: ≥85% validation accuracy, <500ms inference latency

Key decision: **No CNN stage.** MediaPipe replaces spatial feature extraction; LSTM handles temporal modeling. This allows real-time CPU inference at ≥30 FPS.

### Data

- `data/raw/` — static image datasets (ASL Alphabet ~3000 imgs/class, Digits ~100 imgs/class)
- `data/processed/` — landmark sequences as `.npy` files in shape `(30, 63)`, float32
- `data/external/` — third-party metadata / WLASL subsets
- `models/` — trained `.h5` model files (gitignored)

**Training data strategy**: Public datasets are static images and have bias issues. Primary approach is custom self-recorded data via `extract_landmarks.py` targeting 50 samples per class (75 × 50 = 3750 total sequences).

### Vocabulary

75 classes: `a`–`z`, `0`–`9`, plus 39 words (snake_case). Full list in `docs/vocabulary.md`.

### Backend (planned, Phase 3)

Flask + Flask-SocketIO server. WebSocket endpoint receives landmark frames, maintains 30-frame sliding window, runs LSTM inference. REST endpoints: `POST /speech-to-text`, `GET /transcript`. SQLite for conversation history.

### Frontend (planned, Phase 4)

React app. MediaPipe Hands runs **in-browser** (lower latency than backend extraction). Dual-panel layout: left (signer + webcam), right (hearing user + speech input). `useSignRecognition` custom hook.

## Phases (14-week plan)

| Phase | Weeks | Goal |
|-------|-------|------|
| 0 | 1 | Environment setup |
| 1 | 2–3 | Data pipeline & landmark preprocessing |
| 2 | 4–6 | LSTM model training & evaluation |
| 3 | 5–7 | Backend API & WebSocket server |
| 4 | 6–9 | React frontend |
| 5 | 10 | Full system integration |
| 6 | 11–12 | Testing, evaluation, usability |
| 7 | 13–14 | Documentation & defense prep |

Full plan: `docs/sign_learn.md`

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pytest` on push/PR to `dev-ml` and `main` branches using Python 3.11 on ubuntu-latest.
